# Commerce Hub - Product, Marketing & Branding Strategy

> Building a digital product business on public domain Smithsonian art

**Last Updated:** December 2024

---

## Business Overview

### The Opportunity

The Smithsonian Open Access initiative released **4.5+ million images** into the public domain. Most people don't know this exists, and even fewer know how to use these assets commercially. We're bridging that gap by:

1. Curating high-quality artwork from the Smithsonian collection
2. Processing images for commercial use (clean backgrounds, high-res, organized)
3. Packaging into themed bundles designers actually want
4. Distributing across multiple sales channels via Commerce Hub

### Value Proposition

**For Customers:**
- Ready-to-use vintage artwork (no hunting through archives)
- Professionally processed (transparent PNGs, 300 DPI)
- Themed collections (saves hours of curation)
- Commercial license included (public domain = no attribution required)

**For Us:**
- Zero inventory costs (digital products)
- Infinite margin after creation (no COGS)
- Multi-channel distribution (one product → many stores)
- Evergreen content (vintage never goes out of style)
